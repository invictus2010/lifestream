Description: # Lifestream
        
        Lifestream is a Python library to make sense out of your transaction logs. Import a log of your transactional data and let's explore! 
        
        ## Installation
        
        Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install lifestream.
        
        ```bash
        pip install lifestream
        ```
        ## Transactional Data 
        At a minimum, the transactional data you import should have the following: 
        
        * OrderID assoiated with transaction
        * Unique user id associated with transaction
        * Date of transaction
        * Monetary value of transaction
        
        
        | order_id | user_id | date       | monetary_value |
        |----------|---------|------------|----------------|
        | 768      | 13      | 09/13/2020 | $15.12        |
        | 769      | 13249   | 09/13/2020 | $240.00        |
        | 770      | 11424   | 09/13/2020 | $194.34        |
        
        *Is your transactional data in another kind of format? See the `create_transaction_log` function below.*
        
        ## Usage
        This library is inspired by (many of the charts found in this PowerPoint file)[https://www.dropbox.com/s/x7b7e1kq7gk9id1/summarizing%20buyer%20behavior%20in%20excel%20clean.pptx?dl=0] created by (Prof Daniel McCarthy)[https://twitter.com/d_mccar/status/1299972436117643264]. 
        
        Below are some of the methods found within this library. 
        
        Need to create a transaction log that meets the library's requirements? If your data is as raw as the individually purchased items, try this method.
        
        ```python
        
        lifestream.create_transaction_log(df, orderid_col, datetime_col customerid_col, quantity_col, 
        unitprice_col)
        ```
        * **df** is a dataframe of your  data.
        * **orderid_col** the column in df DataFrame that denotes the unique order_id.
        * **datetime_col** the column in df DataFrame that denotes the datetime the purchase was made.
        * **customerid_col** the column in df DataFrame that denotes the unique customer_id.
        * **quantity_col** the column in df DataFrame that denotes the quantity of items purchased in an order.
        * **unitprice_col** the column in df DataFrame that denotes the unit price of items purchased in an order.
        
        
        Want to plot sales by month?
        ```python
        import lifestream
        
        lifestream.sales_chart(transaction_log, datetime_col, ordervalue_col, customerid_col, customer_count = True, title = 'Sales and Customers Per Month', ylabel1 = 'Number of Customers Per Month', ylabel2 = 'Sales ($) per Month')
        ```
        * **transaction_log** is a dataframe of your transactional data.
        * **datetime_col** represents the column of the transaction_log dataframe which contains the datetime of the transaction.
        * **orderid_col** represents the column of the transaction_log dataframe which contains the monetary value of the transaction. 
        * **customerid_col** represents the column of the transaction_log dataframe which contains the unique user id associated with the transaction. 
        * **customer_count** *optional* boolean to indicate whether overlay of new customers per month is desired
        * **title** *optional* represents the title of the chart.
        * **ylabel1** *optional* represents the label on the y-axis of the line chart.
        * **ylabel2** *optional* represents the label on the y-axis of the bar chart.
        
        Want to dig into basic cohort analyses? Plot how many users from a cohort are still spending in subsequent months.
        ```python
        
        lifestream.cohort_retention_chart(transaction_log, datetime_col, customerid_col, ordervalue_col, cohort1, cohort2, cohort3, title, ylabel)
        ```
        * **transaction_log** is a dataframe of your transactional data.
        * **datetime_col** represents the column of the dataframe which contains the datetime of the transaction.
        * **customerid_col** represents the column of the dataframe which contains the unique user id associated with the transaction. 
        * **ordervalue_col** represents the column of the dataframe which contains the monetary value of the transaction. 
        * **cohort1**, **cohort2**, **cohort3** are the three cohorts you are interested in, expressed as 'YYYY-MM' string.
        * **title** *optional* is the title for the plot.
        * **ylabel** *optional* is the label for the y-axis of the plot.
        
        Plot how many new users you are acquiring per month.
        
        ```python
        
        lifestream.new_customers_chart(transaction_log, datetime_col, customerid_col, title, xlabel, ylabel, kind)
        ```
        * **transaction_log** is a dataframe of your transactional data.
        * **datetime_col** represents the column of the dataframe which contains the datetime of the transaction.
        * **customerid_col** represents the column of the dataframe which contains the unique user id associated with the transaction. 
        * **title** *optional* represents the title of the chart.
        * **xlabel** *optional* represents the x-axis of the chart.
        * **ylabel** *optional* represents the y-axis of the chart.
        * **kind** *optional* represents the kind of chart. see the pandas library documentation for the plot method to understand what is available.
        
        Plot the monthly revenue mix by new vs. returning customers. 
        
        ```python
        
        lifestream.customer_type_revenue_mix(transaction_log, datetime_col, customerid_col, ordervalue_col, figsize = (12,8), rotation = 'vertical'
        )
        ```
        * **transaction_log** is a dataframe of your transactional data.
        * **datetime_col** represents the column of the dataframe which contains the datetime of the transaction.
        * **customerid_col** represents the column of the dataframe which contains the unique user id associated with the transaction. 
        * **ordervalue_col** represents the column of the dataframe which contains the monetary value of the transaction. 
        * **figsize** *optional* represents the size of the chart.
